# MovieChatBot
MovieChatBot is a project that uses OpenAI to improve the movie discovery process. Users input a movie-related query in text, and the bot generates an SQL query using OpenAI. This query is executed against a local TMDB database, delivering accurate results.

Data from the TMDB database is transferred to the local database through controllers and schedulers, keeping the information current. MovieChatBot is a tool for movie enthusiasts, offering immediate access to a range of movie-related information such as searching for new releases, top-rated films, or specific movie details üé¨üçø
